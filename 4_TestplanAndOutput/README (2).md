# DISTANCE CALCULATION USING ULTRASONIC SENSOR

# INTRODUCTION
       Ultrasonic sensors are used in this work, as the name implies. 
       Ultrasonic sensors operate by emitting a sound wave that is higher in frequency than human hearing. 
       To send a pulse and receive an echo, our ultrasonic sensors, like many others, use a single transducer.
       By monitoring the duration between delivering and receiving an ultrasonic pulse, the sensor can calculate the distance to a target.
# RESEARCH
       The criteria for the programme to execute or the code to be in effect are simple, 
       and it's an excellent solution for detecting clean things.
# FEATURES
       1.Used to measure the distance of object.
       2.The sensors have a 3mm precision and can measure distances ranging from 2 to 400cm.The sensors have a 3mm precision and can measure distances ranging from 2 to 400cm.
# WORKING
       Ultrasonic sensors operate by emitting a sound wave that is higher in frequency than human hearing. To receive and transmit ultrasonic sound,
       the sensor's transducer functions as a microphone. To send a pulse and receive an echo, our ultrasonic sensors, like many others, use a single transducer.
# SWOT ANALYSIS:
# STRENGTH:
       A low-cost ultrasonic sensor can be used to determine the distance to an obstacle. 
       The sensors have a 3mm precision and can measure distances ranging from 2 to 400cm. 
       The ultrasonic transmitter, ultrasonic receiver, and control circuit are all included in this sensor module.

 # WEAKNESS
       Although we are confident in our sensors' capabilities, 
       we recognise that ultrasonics are not appropriate for all applications.
       Low-thickness focuses, such as foam and fabric, have a proclivity to absorb sound vitality; these materials can be difficult to detect at a distance.           
 # WHAT
       created a system based on a microcontroller that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect distance in real time and shows the results on an LCD display.
 # WHERE:
        There is no physical touch between the sensor and the item in this technology. It uses non-contact technology to accurately measure distance.      
 # HOW
        The Atmega328 is used to show an ultrasonic sensor, which is primarily used to detect the target object's distance.
