# INTRODUCTION:

                       Temperature is measured and controlled with a temperature measuring system. It was created by utilising an Atmega32 in a simulation software called SimulIDE and Embedded C. This technology may be used in automobiles to manage the temperature. Temperature monitoring is required for each subsystem of an Electric Vehicle (EV). To safeguard the power switch (MOSFET/IGBT/SiC), on-board chargers, DC/DC converters, and inverter/motor controls require safe and efficient management. Battery management systems (BMS) also need high-resolution temperature measurements at the cell level. The temperature sensor is without a doubt the one component that must be precise at severe temperatures in order to preserve the system. Accurate temperature information enables the CPU to temperature-compensate the system, allowing electronic components to improve their performance and dependability regardless of driving circumstances. Temperature detection of power switches, power magnetic components, heat sinks, PCBs, and other components is included. Temperature data also aids in the regulated operation of cooling systems. Depending on the sort of regulated process, the type of input sensor and signal required may differ. Thermocouples and resistive thermal devices (RTDs) are common input sensors, as are linear inputs such as mV and mA. Typical standardised thermocouple types include, among others, J, K, T, R, S, B, and L kinds.
# RESEARCH:
                       It is used in automobiles to ensure that the equipment is operating properly in the cold. It uses master slave communication to accept an analogue input and create a temperature in response. Modern automobiles are intelligent! Automobiles now can avoid front and rear end crashes, assist drivers in accelerating and stopping safely on wet and slippery roads, and deploy a slew of air bags to keep passengers safe in the case of an accident. They can also park themselves, identify if you've wandered out of your lane, and even notify you if you've fallen asleep at the wheel. may go on and on about all of the new technology that makes automobiles so smart, but the vehicle's temperature control is an often neglected smart function. The climate settings in most modern automobiles may be adjusted to automated. You select the temperature, and the system regulates and controls the airflow to keep it there. Unlike your house, which usually only has one thermostat to manage the temperature, automobiles contain a variety of components to keep drivers comfortable.
